    \Order Form\  These terms, together with the ""Order Form"" referencing them, make up a software support agreement.  The terms ""Developer"" and ""Customer"" are defined on the <Order Form>.

    \Scope\

        \\  ""Software"" means the software identified on the <Order Form>.

        \\  ""Covered Versions"" depend on the <Order Form>:

            \\  If the <Order Form> specifies a particular version, <Covered Versions> include only that version.

            \\  If the <Order Form> specifies a version range, such as "1.y.z", then <Covered Versions> include the latest <Generally Available> version in that range on the date of this agreement, as well as any new versions within that range that <Developer> makes <Generally Available> during the term of this agreement.

            \\  If the <Order Form> does not specify a particular version or version range, then <Covered Versions> include the latest <Generally Available> version on the date of this agreement, as well as any new versions that <Developer> makes <Generally Available> during the term of this agreement.

            A version of the <Software> is ""Generally Available"" if <Developer> offers to the public for use in production systems.  Versions that <Developer> designates with labels like "Alpha", "Beta", "Preview", "Testing", and "Preview" are not <Generally Available>.

        \\  ""Service Limits"" means any limits on use of <Developer>'s support services specified on the <Order Form>, such as the number of <Customer Personnel> who may contact <Developer> for support, or the maximum number of <Support Requests> <Developer> will respond to per month.

        \Respond to Support Requests\  <Developer> agrees to respond to ""Support Requests"" from <Customer Personnel> about <Covered Versions> of the <Software>.

If the <Order Form> does not specify support channels, <Developer> only agrees to respond to <Support Requests> via e-mail, and to give <Notice> of an e-mail address for <Support Requests> on entering into this agreement.

        \Diagnosis and Resolution\  <Developer> agrees to diagnose and resolve <Support Requests> related to installing <Covered Versions> of the <Software>, configuring standard features of <Covered Versions> of the <Software> per its documentation, and software errors encountered when using <Covered Versions> of the <Software>.

        \Solo Operation\  <Developer> is a ""Solo Operation"" is, on the date of this agreement, <Developer> is an individual or a company with just one technical person capable of responding to <Support Requests>.

        \Technical Support Escalation\  If <Developer> is not a <Solo Operation>, then <Developer> agrees to promptly escalate <Support Requests> that initially responding support personnel cannot resolve independently to a <Developer> engineer responsible for the <Software>.  Where appropriate, initially responding support personnel may connect <Customer Personnel> to engineers directly.

        \Dedicated Support Personnel\  If <Developer> is not a <Solo Operation> and the <Order Form> specifies dedicated support personnel, then <Developer> agrees to assign a limited number of specific support personnel to respond to <Customer>'s <Support Requests>, in order to maximize the chance that <Customer Personnel> will receive support from personnel familiar with <Customer>'s use cases and past<Support Requests>.

            \Business Hours\  If the <Order Form> specifies business hours, <Developer> agrees to respond to <Support Requests> during those hours.

            \Vacation and Sick Days\  If <Developer> is a <Solo Operation>, then <Developer> will not respond to <Support Requests> on days <Developer> takes off as vacation or sick days.  <Developer> agrees to give <Notice> of sick days, and advance <Notice> of vacation days.  <Developer> may take as many sick days and vacation days as <Customer>'s human resources policies allow full-time employees to take, or if <Customer> does not have such a policy, a reasonable number of sick days and vacation days.
